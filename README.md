# Penguin Paradigm
## About Penguin Paradigm
The Paradigm is not just a repository software solution.  Rather, we see it as having three complementary components:

### Flock
there is a vibrant, highly active community supporting the work of the project which shares an  underlying philosophy behind all that it does

### Slides
there are design (and other) principles involved in constructing a successful Penguin “slide” for use with compatible digital objects

### Floes
there are the software components, the Ruby gems, that the Hydra community has constructed which are combined together to provide a local installation

Each of these is of great importance to the Paradigm and each has its own set of pages accessible from the menu bar above.

The Penguin Paradigm maintains three points of presence on the web with information for various audiences:

this site, which is essentially the public brochure for Penguin Paradigm
the Penguin Paradigm wiki, which holds  more detailed information about the Paradigm:  its community, its meetings and events, and its technologies; and
a GitHub site which provides the code, documentation and detailed information aimed at developers
