      <h2>About Penguin Paradigm</h2>
      <p>The Paradigm is not just a repository software solution.  Rather, we see it as having three complementary components:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>The Flock</dt><dd>a vibrant, highly active community supporting the work of the project which shares an  underlying philosophy behind all that it does</dd>
        <dt>The Slide</dt><dd>design (and other) principles involved in constructing a successful Penguin “slide” for use with compatible digital objects</dd>
        <dt>The Floe</dt><dd>software components, the Ruby gems, that the Penguin Paradigm community has constructed which are combined together to provide a local installation</dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>The dark horse candidate for <a href="https://projecthydra.org/">Hydra</a> replacement</h2>
      <p>Penguins are joyful in a challenging environment; penguins weather the worst storms by relying on each other; penguins aren't afraid of a deep dive. That's us: that's the Penguin Paradigm.</p>

      <p>The Penguin Paradigm maintains three points of presence on the web with information for various audiences:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>this site, which is essentially the public brochure for Penguin Paradigm</li>
        <li>the Penguin Paradigm wiki, which holds more detailed information about the Paradigm:  its community, its meetings and events, and its technologies</li>
        <li>a GitHub site which provides the code, documentation and detailed information aimed at developers</li>
      </ol>
